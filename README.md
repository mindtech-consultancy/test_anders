Test task from Mr.anders
Frontend : Test Project developed in Asp .net Core 2.1 using MVC C#.
Backend : Sql Server.
We used Entity Framework, We can use dapper also which is more efficient than enitity framework.
Fitness rating : We did this by giving static conditioning at database side but we can do it by static table also.
As test pupose we didn't give proper UI but more effective UI can be applicable.
