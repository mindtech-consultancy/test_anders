# test_anders

>> Test task from Mr.anders

>> Frontend : Test Project developed in Asp .net Core 2.1 using MVC C#.

>> Backend : Sql Server.

>> We used Entity Framework, but we can use Dapper as well.

>> Fitness rating : We did this by giving conditions in Store Procedure at database side, This can be done with the use of Table also or we can use computed column also to auto populate it in column itself. 

>> As test pupose we didn't give proper UI but more effective UI can be applicable.
